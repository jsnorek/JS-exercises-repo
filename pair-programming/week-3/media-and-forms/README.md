### Tasks

1. Replace the area with the pink/orange background with any image you would like. Feel free to find any picture online you would like. You can change the size if you want it, but make sure the picture maintains its proportions.

2. Add Media Queries for the Mobile Version. If the screen is smaller then 425px the picture should be removed, and at 900px you should have just one column.(you probably will need to test this part in your VSCode, to see the proportions inside the Inspect Element)

3. Using JavaScript:

- Make the button work and console.log the name of the user
- If the user makes a click without inputting a string, alert that the field es mandatory

### Bonus

The HTML file has a `<div class="error">` tag. Print the error message there using DOM manipulation
