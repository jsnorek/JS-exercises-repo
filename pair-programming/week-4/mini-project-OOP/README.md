### Mini Project: Object Oriented Programming in JS

### Task:

- Use the new JS object-oriented programming skills to create an "Event" class.
- Write functions on the "Event" class that will:
  - allow the event host to add tickets with prices and "ticket type" (e.g. regular, VIP, mezzanine, balcony, etc)
  - allows a user to input a price range they are willing to pay to see what ticket types are available to them
- Create a few event objects
- Push the event objects into an array and use [DOM manipulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) to display the list of events to an html page.
